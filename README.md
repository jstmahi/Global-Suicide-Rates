Global Suicide Statistics Analysis Project
Project Overview
This data analytics project focuses on analyzing global suicide statistics across different countries, genders, age groups, and time periods. The goal is to uncover trends, correlations, and insights from the dataset, which includes economic indicators like GDP and population demographics. The analysis helps shed light on how socio-economic factors influence suicide rates worldwide.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains suicide-related information across multiple countries and years. It includes:
Country: The country where the data was collected.
Year: The year of the record.
Sex: Gender (male or female).
Age group: Age categories of individuals.
Suicides_no: The number of suicides recorded.
Population: The population of the group for the given year.
Suicides/100k pop: Suicide rate per 100,000 people.
GDP for year: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country for the year.
GDP per capita: GDP per capita of the country for the corresponding year.
Generation: Generational classification (e.g., Boomers, Generation X).

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
Analyze suicide trends over time and across countries.
Identify correlations between suicide rates and economic factors like GDP.
Explore differences in suicide rates by gender and age group.
Provide insights into how generational shifts may influence suicide rates.

Tools and Skills Used
Tools:
Microsoft Excel: For initial data cleaning, processing, and basic analysis.
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): For advanced data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.
Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and presenting key insights through visualizations.
Skills:
Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, handling duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
Data Visualization: Using Power BI and Python libraries to create meaningful visual representations of the data.
Statistical Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between suicide rates and factors like GDP, population, age, and gender.
Project Structure
/data: Contains the Excel dataset used for analysis.
/notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with Python code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
/visualizations: Power BI dashboards or screenshots summarizing insights.
/reports: Detailed findings from the analysis, including key trends and correlations.
Key Insights
Suicide Rates by Country and Year: Explore how suicide rates vary across different countries and years.
Gender and Age Analysis: Analyze differences in suicide rates between males and females, as well as across various age groups.
Impact of Economic Factors: Investigate the correlation between GDP, population size, and suicide rates.
Generational Trends: Examine how different generations are affected by suicide rates over time.
Suicide per 100k Population: Insights into regions or demographics where suicide rates are particularly high.
Visualizations
Power BI is used to visualize:
Trends in suicide rates across countries and regions.
Breakdown of suicide rates by gender and age group.
Correlations between GDP per capita and suicide rates.
Usage
This project serves as a comprehensive analysis for researchers, policymakers, and data analysts who aim to understand the socio-economic and demographic factors influencing suicide rates. It provides insights that could inform mental health interventions and preventive measures.

How to Run
Download the dataset: The dataset is available in the data folder.
Explore the data: Use the Python notebooks in the notebooks folder to conduct your analysis.
View the Visualizations: Open the Power BI files or images in the visualizations folder for detailed data insights.
Generate Reports: Read through the reports folder to understand the key takeaways from the analysis.
Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data-driven insights into understanding global suicide trends and their relationship with various socio-economic factors. It serves as a valuable resource for addressing mental health challenges and identifying areas for targeted intervention. 

The dashboard can be viewed on kaggle at [https://www.kaggle.com/tavoosi/suicide-data-full-interactive-dashboard](https://www.kaggle.com/tavoosi/suicide-data-full-interactive-dashboard). However, I recommend running and opening it up in R for a better version; all you need to do is to download and run the `suicide data dashboard.rmd` file.
